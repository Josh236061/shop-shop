# Shop Shop
Rice Bootcamp Challenge Assignment 22: Shop Shop 

## Introduction

Task: To expand your knowledge of state management by making a complex application more efficient. To do this, you’ll follow a popular state management 
paradigm called Redux. Redux isn’t directly tied to React, but it is often used with large-scale React applications to avoid prop drilling, which requires developers to 
go through layers of components to get data to other parts of the React component tree. In addition, you’ll learn how to manage online payments using a popular service 
called Stripe. Finally, you’ll add to your experience with GraphQL and PWAs.

## Module Requirements

To succeed in this Challenge, you’ll apply the following skills:

Refer to Redux’s documentation to learn how to refactor an existing application to use Redux.

Convert an existing application’s implementation of global state management from using the Context API to using Redux.
